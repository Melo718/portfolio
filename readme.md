This project required us to make links named  "About me","Portfolio", and "Contact" using Bootstrap and the information we've learned so far.
When each link is clicked on it will change their browser to that link.  
The webpages are different but they all require the same header and links in the same position on each of the pages.
As the webpage shrinks the content should shrink with it and display it evenly.
